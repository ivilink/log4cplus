Version 0.9.8 (August 3 2003)
  - Changed the LogLog class so that it is now reference counted.
  - Restored the LOG4CPLUS_*_STR logging macros.
  - Added support to disable the ERROR and FATAL macros by defining
    LOG4CPLUS_DISABLE_*
  - API Change:  The LOG4CPLUS_TRACE macro now has behavior similar to all of 
    the other logging macros.  If the old behavior is desired, then the new
    LOG4CPLUS_TRACE_METHOD macro should be used.
  - Modified Appender class to support the "Threshold" property.
  - "localtime" is now the default time in log4cplus.
  - The FileAppender no longer prints out the "header" when it opens a file.
  - Added the "immediateFlush" field to the FileAppender class.
  - Changed the API of the LogLevelManager class.
  - Initial port work done to run on MacOS X.
  - Added the HierarchyLocker class
  - Added the ConfigureAndWatchThread class for runtime dynamic reconfiguration.
  - Added several performance enhancements to the InternalLoggingEvent class.


Version 0.9.7 (June 28 2003)
  - Added the log4cplus::DailyRollingFileAppender class.
  - Added the log4cplus::helper::Time class.  Now log with millisecond 
    granularity. (microsecond granularity if the gettimeofday() function is
    available.)
  - Changed log4cplus::spi::InternalLoggingEvent from a POD to a class and
    introduced several performance ehancements to that class.  This class
    can now be extended to introduce "customized" logging.
  - Fixed Bug #757989 - "TraceLogger should not hold a Logger reference"
  - Added TYPE_SOCKLEN_T to configure.in (checking for whether <sys/socket.h> 
    defines `socklen_t').
  - Added the "operator!=" to log4cplus::helpers::SharedObjectPtr.
  - Made changes to make the DEC CXX 6.1 compiler happy.
  - Renamed the tolower and toupper methods to avoid a name collision with a
    macro with the DEC CXX compiler.
  - Removed "-lstdc++" from the list of libraries in all Makefiles.


Version 0.9.6 (June 10 2003)
  - Fixed multiple compiler warnings for the MSVC++ 7 compiler

  - Modified the configure script so that it can build a single-threaded
    library (--enable-threads=no)
  - Added "Filtering" to Appenders.
  - Fixed Bug #741515 - "LogLog is causing a core on HP".
  - Fixed Bug #733944 - "logging in system/local time"
  - Fixed Bug #749040 - "Use of gmtime and localtime not thread-safe"
  - Fixed Bug #750232 - "Copying of Hierarchy should not be allowed"
  - Added an MSVC++ project to build log4cplus as a static library.


Version 0.9.5 (May 19 2003)
  - Removed the LOG4CPLUS_*_STR logging macros.
  - Added support to disable the TRACE, DEBUG, and INFO macros by defining
    LOG4CPLUS_DISABLE_*
