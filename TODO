Possible enhancements and directions of development, in no particular
order:

- XML appender compatible with Chainsaw GUI.

- EventLog library appender.

- org.apache.log4j.net.ZeroConfSocketHubAppender.

- Friendlier thread ID, %T.

- log4j like MDC.

- Reading log4j-like XML configuration files.

- More flexible events format for transport (ASN.1?, XML?).

- Syslog appender capable of logging using UDP to another host.
